The methods are described in the course. Here we will cover the methods PCA, PLS1 and PLS2, N-integration (multi block PLS-DA) and P-integration (multi-group PLS-DA). Figure 0.1: Different types of analyses with mixOmics (Rohart et al. 2017).The biological questions, the number of data sets to integrate, and the type of response variable, whether qualitative (classification), quantitative (regression), one (PLS1) or several (PLS) responses, all drive the choice of analytical method. All methods featured in this diagram include variable selection except rCCA. In N-integration, rCCA and PLS enable the integration of two quantitative data sets, whilst the block PLS methods (that derive from the methods from Tenenhaus and Tenenhaus (2011)) can integrate more than two data sets. In P-integration, our method MINT is based on multi-group PLS (Eslami et al. 2014).The following activities cover some of these methods. "]
